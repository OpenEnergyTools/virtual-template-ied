## Virtual Template IED Plugin

IED generation menu plugin for CoMPAS Open SCD (next)

## Transformation rules applied in this plugin

- Each `Function` and `Subfunction` with more than one `LNode` becomes a Logical Device (name attributes are mapped to `inst` attribute of `LDevice`).
- `Function` name attribute becomes the value of the `inst` attribute of the element `LDevice`. !! This plugin does not normalize the `name` attributes to fit to the restriction of the `inst` attributes. This is up to the user to restrict `name` attributes in function-type element to alphanumeric characters, including `_`. -`Function`s with the same name inside substation elements (e.g. same `Function`s in different Bays) are modelled to `Ã¬nst` by prefixing the next higher Substation/Process Level (e.g. `AA1E1A01Protection`).
- For `LNode` within leaf `Subfunction` (one with only one child `LNode`) the prefix is modelled from the `Subfunction` name attribute.
